# 8BIT-RISC-CPU
“Verilog-based 8-bit RISC processor with ALU, control unit, register file, and instruction memory. Designed and simulated in Xilinx Vivado.”
# 8-bit RISC Processor

## 🧠 Overview
This project implements an 8-bit RISC CPU using Verilog HDL.  
It includes a simple instruction set architecture (ISA) and key components like:
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Register File
- Control Unit (FSM-based)
- Program Counter & Instruction Memory

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado (RTL Design & Simulation)
- ModelSim (Testbench Verification)
- GitHub for Version Control
